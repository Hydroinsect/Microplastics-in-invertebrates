# Microplastics-in-invertebrates
The R code for our paper :"Global asymmetry in microplastic ingestion by benthic invertebrates"
The "GLMM_MP.R" file contains the code for calculating the GLMM and the related statistical results. The "Chao2_MP.R" file includes the code for calculating the Chao2 index at the taxa, genus, and family levels. The data required to run the code can be found in the csv files. These codes only include preliminary plot results; the figures in the main text and Supplementary Information have undergone further processing.
